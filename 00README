Easel - a library of C functions for biological sequence analysis
Version @EASEL_VERSION@; @EASEL_DATE@

------------------------------------------------------------------

Easel is an ANSI C code library for computational analysis of
biological sequences using probabilistic models. Easel is used by
HMMER, the profile hidden Markov model software that underlies the
Pfam protein families database, and by Infernal, the profile
stochastic context-free grammar software that underlies the Rfam RNA
family database. Easel aims to make similar applications more robust
and easier to develop, by providing a set of reusable, documented, and
well-tested functions.

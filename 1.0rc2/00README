------------------------------------------------------------------

Easel is a C code library for computational analysis of biological
sequences using probabilistic models. Easel is used by HMMER, the
profile hidden Markov model software that underlies the Pfam protein
families database, and by Infernal, the profile stochastic
context-free grammar software that underlies the Rfam RNA family
database. Like any code library, Easel aims to make applications more
robust and easier to develop, by providing a set of reusable,
documented, and well-tested functions.

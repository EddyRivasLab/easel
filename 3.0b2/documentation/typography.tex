Easel.

C code such as {\smaller\ttfamily esl\_foo\_function()} is set in
smaller, tt font.

Emphasized C code such as {\smaller\ttfamily\bfseries
esl\_foo\_function()} is set in smaller, tt, bold font.

A {\bfseries new term} is set in bold font when first defined.

Names of programs like {\scshape HMMER} and {\scshape BLAST} and
{\scshape Easel} are set in small caps.

Names of Easel's modules, such as 
{\smaller\sffamily\bfseries alphabet} or 
{\smaller\sffamily\bfseries MSA},
are set in small, sans-serif, bold font.

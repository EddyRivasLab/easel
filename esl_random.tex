The \eslmod{random} module contains routines for generating uniformly
distributed pseudorandom numbers and sampling random deviates from
distributions. The heart of the module is the \ccode{esl\_random()}
pseudorandom number generator.

The \ccode{esl\_random()} random number generator is portable,
reentrant, and threadsafe. It gives reproducible results on all
platforms.

The default \ccode{esl\_random()} generator uses the Mersenne Twister
algorithm MT19937 \citep{Matsumoto98}. MT19937 has strong properties,
including a period of $2^{19937}-1$ and equidistribution over $2^{32}$
values.

An alternative, faster generator can also be chosen, which is a
classic simple linear congruential generator with $a=69069$
\citep{Knu-81a}. This still has reasonable properties, but is much
faster to initialize (about 20x) and somewhat faster to generate
samples (about 25\%). The fast generator is advantageous when speed is
of essence, especially when a small number of samples will be taken
from the generator.

%% A bit stream generated internally by \ccode{esl\_random()} passes 14
%% tests in a National Institute of Standards and Technology statistical
%% benchmark for cryptanalysis \citep{Rukhin01} with performance
%% comparable to binary sequences from irrational numbers.\footnote{The
%% NIST tests are necessary but not sufficient to show adequate
%% ``randomness''. Although the bitstream passes NIST benchmarks, the 31
%% individual bits in \ccode{esl\_random()}'s internal unnormalized
%% random integer are not adequately random, because its maximum value is
%% slightly less than $2^{31}-1$. Only the double value returned by
%% \ccode{esl\_random()} should be used as a random sample, or the
%% integer value of \ccode{r->rnd}, but not the 31 individual bits of
%% \ccode{r->rnd}.  The fact that the bitstream passes the NIST tests
%% only indicates that there are no glaring problems in
%% \ccode{esl\_random()}'s generator.}

Table~\ref{tbl:random_api} lists the functions in the \eslmod{random}
API. The module implements one object, \ccode{ESL\_RANDOMNESS}, which
contains state information for the random number generator.  This
makes random number generation reentrant and threadsafe. You can have
more than one active generator and they will not interfere with each
other. The object is meant to be opaque; you should not need to use
its contents.

\subsection{Example of using random}

Figure~\ref{fig:random_example} shows a program that initializes the
random number generator with a seed you provide on the command line,
then samples 10 random numbers using \ccode{esl\_random()}.

\begin{figure}
\input{cexcerpts/random_example}

\end{figure}

When a \ccode{ESL\_RANDOMNESS} object is created with
\ccode{esl\_randomness\_Create()}, it needs to be given a \emph{seed},
an integer $\geq 0$, which specifies the initial state of the
generator. After a generator is seeded, it is typically never seeded
again. A series of \ccode{esl\_random()} calls generates a
pseudorandom number sequence from that starting point. If you create
two \ccode{ESL\_RANDOMNESS} objects seeded identically, they are
guaranteed to generate the same random number sequence on all
platforms. This makes it possible to reproduce stochastic simulations.
Thus, if you run the example multiple times, you get the same ten
numbers, because the generator is always seeded with 42.

Often one wants different runs to generate different random number
sequences, which creates a chicken and the egg problem: how can we
select a pseudorandom seed for the pseudorandom number generator?
Calling \ccode{esl\_randomness\_Create(0)} (i.e., a seed argument of
0) causes Easel to select an arbitrary seed. The arbitrary seed is
constructed by a combination of the current time and (if available)
the process id. Two different \ccode{ESL\_RANDOMNESS} objects created
this way should (but are not guaranteed to) produce different
pseudorandom number sequences.
